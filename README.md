# Landing-page
Foundations course project 1

File folder contains html and css documents, images folder with blank
 images, and font folder. 

Exercise completed as per instructions with standard page setup with 
filler material. May return to add original content.

Attempted to style document with flexbox properties to allow user to
shrink content. Unable to fit section one main content material on 
page when shrinking - will return to fix at a later date.

This exercise was beneficial in practicing fully setting up an html
document, a css style sheet, flexbox alignment properties, using
git and github, and the command line.
